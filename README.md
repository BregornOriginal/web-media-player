# web-media-player
 
On this proyect I will work to create a Web page where will be embedd videos of YouTube. So you can choose one of them and play it like a video player page.
It's a good plan to have a section of the page whit the navegation bar, another section whit the video and other whit a sidebar.

>I will use HTML and CSS to build the page. It's not necesary to use JavaScript to do it.
